Top 3 project ideas:

1- Chess game: we define a Board class and we have a chess pieces class that is the parent of every single piece class(inheritance) and also we have a player class. The moving rule of chess pieces defines in their own class. The game rules and checking possible moves logic implement in board class. (Maybe we use A* algorithm to implement artificial intelligence player)

2- A quiz game: First we collect a database of questions. We implement a game class for managing main activities and a question class for defining every question objects. And a player class to calculate playersâ€™ scores and priorities and analyze their games.

3- Internship portal: we define 3 classes for students, companies and universities. And in Main class we manage these classes.
